# Business-Insights-360
Problem Statement:
AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly expanding consumer electronics company, has faced challenges stemming from its reliance on Excel for data analysis. This outdated approach has proven ineffective, leading to significant losses in the Latin American market. Recognizing the need for deeper insights, senior management has launched a comprehensive data analytics initiative to enhance performance using data from the past year.

Solution:

As an aspiring Data Analyst, I developed Power BI reports that offer valuable insights to various departments, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions. The reports include:

⭐ Finance View: A comprehensive analysis of profit and loss statements, net sales trends, and assessments of top-performing products and customers.

⭐ Sales View: Insights into customer and product performance, including key metrics such as net sales, gross margins, and unit economics.

⭐ Marketing View: A thorough analysis of product performance, market and regional trends, and evaluations of GM% and NP% across different segments.

⭐ Supply Chain View: An evaluation of forecast accuracy, net errors, and key metrics by product.

⭐ Executive View: A strategic overview providing leadership with the ability to assess the organization from various angles and make high-level evaluations.
